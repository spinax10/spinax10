I'm Spinax, or Zach Frey. I'm trying to find my way in the world, and I think I'm on the right path :)
I'm currently learning a ton of coding right now (including how to properly use Github), mostly involving robots, sensing, and machine learning. I will occasionally 
have a different project here and there that I'll develop too :) I also play guitar and I'm super interested in electronic circuit design for that purpose, despite having
little knowledge on wave generation (yet :D)

I'll upload the various coding projects and other random stuff to here as I go along. If something doesn't work, use my email zspinax10@gmail.com to let me know, and 
I'll try and fix it quickly!

I also don't like emojis. They feel creepy and uncanny to me :^)
